# dsh-ui-appearance

[中文](README.md) · English

> This repository is the customized `@kiligzzz/dsh-ui-appearance` fork. Fix releases and prebuilt packages are available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kiligzzz/dsh-ui-appearance/releases). Download the `.tgz` and run `dsh plugin --profile <name> add /absolute/path/kiligzzz-dsh-ui-appearance-0.1.7.tgz`. This fork is not published to npm; the unscoped npm package and installation script below belong to upstream and do not include this fork's fixes. Do not enable both appearance plugins at once.

An appearance customization plugin for the DeepSeek Harness WebUI — a freely re-colorable theme palette, wallpaper/video backgrounds, glassmorphism and background ambience, all previewed live and persisted automatically. Works in both the WebUI and DSH Desktop.

> Zero core-code changes: everything goes through the official plugin mechanism (`ctx.theme.overrideTokens()` theme extension point and the `settings.general.item` slot). Uninstalling restores the stock UI completely.

## Features

**Theme colors** — 6 color roles: accent, background, panel, input, text, border. Each role has a color picker and HEX input; text selection and the keyboard focus ring follow the accent automatically; message bubbles follow the accent too (keeping its hue when translucent); the top-left logo wordmark ("harness") follows the accent as well.

**Wallpaper background** — Click to upload or drag in an image (JPG / PNG / WebP / GIF), or **paste an image/video URL to load it in one click** (auto-routed by extension; works with CORS-friendly hosts); the original quality is kept and stored in IndexedDB as a full-UI wallpaper (images over 4096px are scaled down proportionally, no quality drop). Brightness is sampled on upload (dark wallpapers lift the surface family) and the **dominant hue is auto-derived as the accent color**, so wallpaper and UI tones stay in harmony. **Video backgrounds** (MP4 / WebM, muted loop, mutually exclusive with images) are also supported; both images and videos live in IndexedDB, keeping localStorage quota free.

**Glassmorphism & translucency** — Panel opacity and glass-blur sliders let the sidebar, settings panel, chat area, task panels, cards and buttons melt into the wallpaper instead of sitting as solid blocks; the sidebar can stay opaque on its own. **Input and code blocks have independent opacity knobs** (100% = follow the panel opacity). Emphasized text chips (`pnpm-lock.yaml`, `lib/`) keep a low-alpha accent tint — emphasis via hue, not solid fill — with an "emphasis tint" slider (0% = fully transparent) for independent tuning.

**Background ambience** — Three independent sliders: background opacity (how strong the wallpaper is), background blur (pushes it into the distance), and a scrim that auto-tints with the light/dark scheme to keep text on the image readable.

**Presets to start from** — Default / Midnight / Ocean / Forest / Rose / Monochrome; apply one click and keep fine-tuning, never locked in.

**Scheme sharing** — Export your palette as JSON (copied to clipboard), paste to import; sharing a theme is one snippet of text.

Every change applies live — no refresh, no save button.

## Installation

### Option 1: npm one-liner (recommended)

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <name> add dsh-ui-appearance
```

### Option 2: one-command script (Windows, no npm account and no git needed)

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Invoke-WebRequest 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TQSY114514/dsh-ui-appearance/main/install.ps1' -OutFile install.ps1; .\install.ps1"
```

The script pulls the pre-built package straight from the npm registry (the published tarball ships the built `lib/`), links it into the profile's own `node_modules` and registers it in that profile's `package.json` (a `dependencies` entry plus `dsh.profile.bundles`, matching what `dsh plugin add` produces) — idempotent, safe to re-run. Optional parameters:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -Version '0.1.6'      # pin a version (default: latest release)
.\install.ps1 -DshHome 'D:\.dsh'    # custom DSH home (default %DSH_HOME% or %USERPROFILE%\.dsh)
.\install.ps1 -ProfileName 'web'    # target profile (default web; must be initialized)
```

### Option 3: from source (verified end to end)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TQSY114514/dsh-ui-appearance.git
dsh plugin --profile <name> add file:<path-to-clone>
```

Uninstall: `dsh plugin --profile <name> remove dsh-ui-appearance` (for the script install, delete the junction under the profile's `node_modules` plus the `dependencies`/`bundles` entries it added to the profile's `package.json`).

**Updating**: after a new release, simply re-run `add` or the install script to upgrade to the latest version.

> **DSH Desktop users**: Desktop keeps its own profiles, independent from the WebUI. All three methods above work — just install into the profile Desktop actually activates (named `desktop` by default; inside the built-in Desktop terminal, a plain `dsh plugin` already targets the active profile).

> Both installation paths (npm registry and `file:` source install) are verified end to end: the host half has zero `@deepseek-ai` runtime dependencies, and both the browser and the Host load correctly. After cloning, `pnpm install` builds automatically; after code changes, re-run `pnpm install && pnpm prepare` and restart `dsh web`.
> Release history: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Usage

1. Open the WebUI, go to Settings → General in the sidebar.
2. Below the Appearance row, find "个性化外观" (Personalized appearance) and expand it.
3. Pick a preset for a quick skin, fine-tune the 6 color roles with pickers or HEX input, upload or drag in a wallpaper/video, and drag the ambience and interface sliders.
4. Done. Everything applies live — no refresh, no save.

Settings panel at a glance:

| Section | Controls |
|---|---|
| Presets | Default / Midnight / Ocean / Forest / Rose / Monochrome; free to keep tuning after applying |
| Theme colors | 6 roles × (picker + HEX): accent, background, panel, input, text, border |
| Background | Image upload/replace/remove, video upload/remove, **load from URL (image/video)**, image opacity, background blur, scrim |
| Interface | Panel opacity, input opacity, code-block opacity, emphasis tint, keep sidebar opaque, glass blur |
| Color scheme | Export palette, import palette (JSON text) |

## Persistence & reset

- Settings live in browser localStorage (key `dsh-ui-appearance.settings`); they survive refresh and restart and sync across tabs.
- Removing the plugin from the profile restores the stock UI: disposal reclaims every overridden token, stylesheet and background layer.
- Note: settings follow the browser — switching browsers or clearing site data loses them; wallpapers are stored at original quality in IndexedDB (localStorage only carries the record key), free from the localStorage quota, and persistent storage is requested from the browser to lower eviction risk.

## How it works

| Capability | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Colors | `ctx.theme.overrideTokens()` overrides `--dsw-alias-*` semantic tokens; light/dark switches re-apply automatically, derived colors are computed per mode |
| Background layer | A dedicated fixed-position layer above the page background and below the content, driven by CSS variables |
| Glassmorphism | The background layer is blurred as a whole (`filter: blur`, background blur + glass sliders summed); `#root` is untouched, so no `backdrop-filter` containing-block side effects |
| Translucency | Surface tokens are baked to `rgba()` per mode (role color → dark-flip derived → stock surface table), no `color-mix` dependency, works in every browser; coverage includes the settings panel (`bg-layer-2`), task panels/queue dock/goal bar (`specific-tip`), inline code and code blocks (`markdown-*`), the command (plus) button hovers (`selector` / `interactive-bg-hover-solid`), and the primary action button hovers (`button-info-hover` / `button-primary-hover` follow the input opacity, so hovers never snap back to solid) |
| Emphasis & translucency | Primary buttons and emphasized text (`markdown-inline-code`) go translucent but keep the brand hue: buttons at accent × input opacity (hovers included), text chips at accent × 0–45% (default 22%, matching the harness's own reference-chip alpha) — emphasis via hue, not solid fill |
| Bubble color | Dedicated bubble settings were removed: the harness renders its only bubble background on user messages (assistant turns have none), so bubbles follow the accent (at panel opacity); stock pale blue when no accent is set |
| Persistence | Browser localStorage (the harness settings gateway only allows browser writes for product namespaces), schema-validated and clamped on load |

## Compatibility & limitations

- Works with [DSH Desktop](https://github.com/anywhere-labs/deepseek-harness-desktop): usable in both advanced mode (native desktop layout) and compatible mode (stock upstream Web client) (screenshots under Screenshots); Desktop profiles are separate from the WebUI — install into the profile Desktop activates (see Installation)
- Translucency is baked as plain `rgba()`; the sliders stay smooth at all values. Glass and background blur merge into one blur of the background layer (the sum of both sliders) — no `backdrop-filter`, so fixed-position elements never change their containing block; low-end devices can set the blur back to 0.
- Dark wallpapers or dark background colors trigger a coordinated surface-family flip; an explicitly set text color still wins.
- Each color role is a single value shared by both modes; derived colors are computed per mode automatically.
- Images: no compression, no size limit (200 MB sanity cap) — originals are stored in IndexedDB directly; images over 4096px are rescaled proportionally (re-encoded as WebP; GIF animation survives when within the bound). Legacy data-URL wallpapers migrate into IndexedDB automatically on upgrade. Persisted data is validated and clamped against the schema on load, so hand-edited or stale localStorage can never produce invalid styles.
- Video backgrounds: 50 MB cap; H.264 (MP4) or VP8/VP9 (WebM) recommended; unsupported codecs (e.g. HEVC) degrade back to the wallpaper automatically; replacing a video cleans up the old IndexedDB record.
- Syntax-highlight text colors (shiki `--shiki-token-*`) are a separate syntax-language palette and do not follow the accent (IDE convention); with a white accent, chip backgrounds are white and translucent, visually near-invisible on light surfaces — normal physics, not a bug.
- Bubbles follow the accent and have no dedicated color setting: the harness renders its only bubble background on user messages, and assistant turns have no bubble at all (a rendering fact the plugin cannot split); bubbles stay stock pale blue when no accent is set.

## FAQ

- **Q: Customizer panel does not appear in DSH settings after installation/update?**
  - **Check Profile**: Verify the plugin is installed to the active profile (DSH Desktop defaults to `desktop`, WebUI defaults to `web`; run `dsh plugin list` to check).
  - **Build & Restart**: When installing from source, ensure `pnpm prepare` was run to compile `lib/` before restarting DSH services (e.g. `dsh web`).
  - **Clear Cache**: Hard-refresh via `Ctrl + F5` (`Cmd + Shift + R` on macOS) to purge old bundle caches.
- **Q: Where are my appearance configurations saved? How to migrate/backup?**
  - Settings are saved in browser `localStorage` (key `dsh-ui-appearance.settings`), while original wallpaper images and videos reside in `IndexedDB`.
  - **Backup & Migrate**: Under the "Color Schemes" section in the panel, click "Export Scheme" to copy JSON. On another browser or machine, paste and click "Import" to restore instantly.
- **Q: Does uninstalling the plugin leave stale styles or break the stock DSH UI?**
  - Not at all. Built strictly on official `ctx.theme.overrideTokens()` and settings slots with zero core code changes. Running `dsh plugin remove dsh-ui-appearance` fully reclaims all injected tokens, stylesheets, and background layers, cleanly restoring stock UI.
- **Q: Are there conflicts when running alongside third-party plugins (e.g. sidebars, overlays)?**
  - **Stacking issues resolved**: Starting from v0.1.5, the background layer is pushed to `z-index: -1` and `#root` creates no stacking context, ensuring third-party top-level panels (such as `dsh-better-sidebar`) and the settings dialog layer properly without interference ([#10](https://github.com/TQSY114514/dsh-ui-appearance/issues/10)).
  - **Style override check**: If another plugin injects hardcoded global CSS overrides, styles may clash. Temporarily disable other UI plugins to isolate the issue.
- **Q: Wallpaper or video background fails to load?**
  - **Local Files**: Originals stored in IndexedDB (auto-scaled above 4096px, GIF animation preserved); videos capped at 50 MB (MP4 H.264 / WebM VP8/VP9 recommended, unsupported codecs fallback to wallpaper).
  - **Remote URLs**: Certain CDNs enforce hotlink protection or omit CORS headers, which browser security blocks. Download and upload locally, or use CORS-friendly direct links.
